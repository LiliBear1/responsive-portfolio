## Process

This website is to display advanced CSS Skills. 

The layout demonstrtates skills learnt regarding grids, flexbox, nesting etc.

The links at the top will go to the relevant sections.

The Contact me section will allow the viewer to call me (placeholder number for now), view my LinkedIn, view my Github or email me (placeholder email for now).

## Additional notes

This project is still very much a work in progress and I will update it as we get involved with more projects, I've found CSS flexbox challenging, so I will be requesting further tutoring on this and hopefully update my page to look a bt more put together.
